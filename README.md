I transitioned from a bachelor's degree in Environmental Engineering at Tsinghua University to a career in software engineering. I hold master's degrees in Data Science from Columbia University and Computer Science from Georgia Tech. This unique academic journey has given me valuable insights into becoming a software engineer, particularly from a non-computer science background. I excel at finding and utilizing resources effectively for continuous learning in this field.
