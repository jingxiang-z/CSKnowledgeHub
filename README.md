## How to use this hub

- Exam cram: skim each page's top summary for definitions, formulas, pitfalls
- Interview prep: use diagrams and worked examples to explain concepts aloud
- Fundamentals review: deep-dive into core CS concepts for technical interviews

## What this hub is not

- Not a LeetCode dump; not a replacement for full textbooks
- Not a copy-paste farm; we cite sources and encourage deeper reading

## Call for contributions

- Add concise "exam cram" summaries to existing pages
- Add or improve diagrams for complex topics
- File content requests or bugs via issue templates

## Acknowledgments

The foundational content in this repository is curated from coursework and materials from:

- **Georgia Institute of Technology** - Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS)
- **Columbia University** - Graduate Computer Science courses

We are grateful to the faculty, teaching assistants, and course designers whose work has contributed to this educational resource. This repository represents a synthesis and reorganization of these materials for exam preparation and interview readiness.

Additional content has been contributed by the open-source community, focused on core computer science fundamentals.
