## How to use this hub

**Get the Full Picture:**  
Start by exploring the [Topics](#topics) section to understand the breadth of computer science fundamentals. See how algorithms connect to systems, how databases relate to distributed computing, and how ML builds on statistics.

**Targeted Study:**
- **Exam prep**: Skim each page's top summary for key definitions, formulas, and common pitfalls
- **Interview prep**: Use diagrams and worked examples to explain concepts clearly and confidently
- **Knowledge gaps**: Jump to specific topics to fill in missing pieces of your CS foundation
- **Big picture**: Browse multiple topics to understand how different areas of CS interconnect

## What this hub is not

- **Not a LeetCode problem dump** - This is a fundamentals knowledge base, not a coding practice site
- **Not a textbook replacement** - Think of it as structured notes and a roadmap; we cite sources for deeper learning
- **Not framework/tool tutorials** - Focus is on timeless CS fundamentals, not specific technologies
- **Not a copy-paste resource** - We emphasize understanding concepts and their connections

## Acknowledgments

This repository originated from coursework and materials from:

- **Georgia Institute of Technology** - Graduate Computer Science courses
- **Columbia University** - Graduate Computer Science courses

We are deeply grateful to the faculty, teaching assistants, and course designers at both institutions whose excellent teaching formed the foundation of this knowledge base. This repository represents a synthesis, reorganization, and expansion of those materials to help learners grasp the full structure of computer science fundamentals.

Additional contributions from the open-source community continue to enhance and expand this knowledge hub.
